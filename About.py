st.write("""**Every year 1.761.000,00 people die because of lung cancer. Every 2.2 minutes a new diagnosis comes
up. Also heart disease kills an estimated 9 million people each year. Statistics are crucial and sad for the
patients and for their families.
Lung cancer and heart attack are the most sneaky diseases. If people are not having full body health
controls regularly they may end up with learning the diagnosis at the last stage which means near to
death. Realizing or being diagnosed at the early stages increases the possibility of winning the disease
by a significant percentage. Yet the problem is we can not understand whether the storm is coming or
not. What if we can predict having lung cancer or heart attack way before the disease comes up? What
if we can push people that may have lung cancer to have full body controls regularly? What if we can
keep them alive with this?
These questions lead Scientia to take action and jump into the situation. We know that even the best
doctors can not predict whether a person will have lung cancer and heart attack or not, so at this point
why do not we use the power of data.
Our aim is to serve in both key points. We aim to predict the lung cancer and heart attack possibility for
the patients in their future so that we can increase the proportion of winning lung cancer and heart
attack victims and push people to consider their health before it is too late. Another dimension is to
provide hospitals a detailed scientific report for their financial decisions, operations, service quality and
the ethical side of being a hospital. Depending on that our AI based tool provides them with predictions
about their current patience portfolio. Which means that they can predict the portion of their patience
about having lung cancer or heart attack or not for the future and they can have a lot of metrics,
decisions, optimizations overall. For example they can have customer lifetime value depending on the
monetary value lung cancer or heart attack patience or they can prepare themselves for enough and
quality service power for the future expected patience to provide them best service and increase the
possibility to win those diseases.
In addition, the most important part is that hospitals can force their patience to consider their health
with suggestions or they can start treatment and arrange programs for the ones that have the highest
possibility to have these diseases. At the same time this tool that we provide can lead the individuals to
be aware of this fact and live by concerning their life and health more.
People can not know whether they will have these diseases or not but data driven technology can do
this and lead the way. We are the ones that lead this dark way with a candle in our hands. Also this
candle is growing as time passes and we generate more data so that we can lighten the way and lighten
humanity from this perspective.
Early diagnosis saves lives.
